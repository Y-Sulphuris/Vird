# Vird
Research project, programming language aimed at
finding maximum flexibility (both syntactically and semantically)
with the simplest possible language model

So its development basically is
"do multiple complex thing, then spend weeks simplifying them until
it starts to seem obvious ~~what took you so long~~"

The language syntax is pretty similar to Lisp

Pre-releases are not backwards compatible (unlike releases)
